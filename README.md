# Hi, Iâ€™m Fedor ğŸ‘‹
IÂ have over 11Â years ofÂ experience inÂ web development and UX/UI design.

Last four years, IÂ primarily worked asÂ aÂ tech lead onÂ aÂ variety ofÂ web-based enterprise-level projects.

IÂ have worked inÂ the automotive, banking, and transportation sectors.
AsÂ aÂ developer, IÂ have solid experience with Typescript, NodeJS, and React.

Although most ofÂ myÂ experience isÂ inÂ web development, IÂ canâ€™t define myself just asÂ aÂ developer, designer, orÂ manager.
IÂ have aÂ variety ofÂ hobbies such aÂ music production, photography, and hiking.
Since the inspiration, while learning new skills, isÂ aÂ source ofÂ energy forÂ me,
IÂ am constantly learning new things and donâ€™t want toÂ bound myself with one field.
