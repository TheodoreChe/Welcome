# Hi, I’m Fedor 👋
I have over 11 years of experience in web development and UX/UI design.

Last four years, I primarily worked as a tech lead on a variety of web-based enterprise-level projects.

I have worked in the automotive, banking, and transportation sectors.
As a developer, I have solid experience with Typescript, NodeJS, and React.

Although most of my experience is in web development, I can't define myself just as a developer, designer, or manager. 
I have a variety of hobbies such a music production, photography, and hiking. 
Since the inspiration, while learning new skills, is a source of energy for me, 
I am constantly learning new things and don't want to bound myself with one field.
